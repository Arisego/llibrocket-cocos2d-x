llibrocket-cocos2d-x
====================

LibRocket interfaces for cocos2d-x, what's left is that you have to inject inputs yourself, it's pretty easy. Good Luck!

You need to inject input to librocket yourself.

Just include RocketSingle.h and use RocketLayer as a ccsprite, you can modify the class to cclayer back. There are no difference by now.
